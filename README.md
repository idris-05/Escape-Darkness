# About the Game
Escape Darkness is a 2D monochrome platformer featuring Dr. Eren,
a scientist using a time-travel machine to find his lost wife. 
Alongside his loyal cat, Mikasa, he navigates a mysterious prison 
filled with bizarre obstacles, using unique abilities like teleportation 
and time-switching. As the journey unfolds, Mikasa reveals 
the truth to Dr. Eren: he cannot alter time, and must accept his loss 
to escape the darkness.

This game was developed during a GameJam, where it won third place and received the award for Best Audio.
